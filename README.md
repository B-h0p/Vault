# Vault

Vault is a lightweight CLI that stores, encrpyts, and opens up URL's. Password protection is included, and all data is stored in a single JSON file. Note that I didn't really have security in mind (and also I didn't want to place files where they likely won't be welcome), so the json is stored in the same directory as the executable. Despite this, the mentality I had while developing was that the end-user would place the main executable in a hidden folder/ drive, and use a shortcut to access the app

This app doesn't really have a reason for existing to be honest. The main reason I created the project was to create a proof-of-concept for a particular cipher. A python demo for this encryption/ decryption methodology is included.

Feel free to clone and mess around with it, and hmu on instagram if you want me to add/ fix anything. Just know that I won't update/ maintain this forever though.


As a final note, I'll say that i'm fairly new to Rust - as such, you'll see that I'm only using the languages basic concepts here. Likewise, I suck bad at programming so you'll notice that my implementation is terrible lmao.
